Our teams program can be compiled and run on the linux boxes in the CCIS Lab by entering the following into the command line:

1. Run the cs4500 script in the src folder using the command line as follows:
./cs4500 <inputfile> <outputfile> [-h] [-help] [-all] [-maxDepth (depth)]

<inputfile> is the filepath of the input text file to be processed.
<outputfile> is the desired filepath of the outputted file ending in the filename.
If there is already a file with the desired filename at the <outputfile> location, it will be overwritten.

Optional Flags:
-all
Ouput all generated test cases even if an equality test could not be generated

-maxDepth (depth)
Explicitly set the maximum call depth for generated test cases. The maximum depth is 3 by default.

-h or -help
Shows help information

CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:
The current iteration of the program tends to fill its allocated amount of memory when given very complex Algebraic Specs as input.
We are currently working on a fix for this problem.
